# sp file from perkin-elmer into EEM

This R script is intended to import the .sp files generated by the PerkinElmer fluorometer into a single .csv file. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Set the fluorometer to an emission range of 300–600 nm and an excitation range of 240–450 nm at 5 nm. This creates 43 SP files. 

Each sp file must be save as ASCII from the FLWinlab software.
